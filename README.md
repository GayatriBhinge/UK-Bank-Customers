# Introduction

### This project is centered around a detailed analysis of customer data from a UK bank branch, focusing on customers from various regions and age groups. The management team is interested in gaining insights into their customer demographics, financial behaviors, and trends. Specifically, they are looking to understand the distribution of customers by region and gender, evaluate financial metrics based on job classifications and age ranges, and identify trends in customer acquisition throughout the year 2015. Additionally, they want to determine which customers hold the largest account balances to enhance their high-value client management strategies.Understanding these insights is critical for the bank to improve customer service, tailor marketing strategies, and make informed decisions related to product offerings, customer engagement, and regional focus. By analyzing this data, the bank can identify potential areas of growth, optimize customer outreach, and ensure they are catering to the needs of their diverse customer base.


# Objectives:

### The primary objective of this project is to analyze the customer data from a UK bank branch, focusing on several key performance indicators (KPIs). The analysis aims to determine the total number of unique customers across various regions and to examine the gender distribution percentages within each region. Additionally, the project will evaluate the average balance held by customers based on both job classifications and age ranges. Another objective is to identify the trends in the number of new customers onboarded each month during 2015, providing insights into customer acquisition patterns. Lastly, the project will determine the top two customers with the highest total account balance, allowing the bank to identify and prioritize its most valuable clients. These objectives will enable management to make data-driven decisions regarding customer engagement and business strategies.
